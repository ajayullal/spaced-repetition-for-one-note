# Spaced repetition
Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique where newly learnt and more difficult content are revised more frequently while older and less difficult content are revised less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been shown to increase rate of learning.
